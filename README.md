# AssociationAnalysis

This code currently prints out the outputs required for the report for task 1 and 2. This code has a main function where the user can find example command to read data from a provided file path into a variable database, call apriori algorithm to generate list of all frequent itemsets with a given minimum support, and call rule generation algorithm to generate list of all confident rules with a given minimum confidence. Following from these three example commands in the main function, the user can find a gen_task_2 function where all template outputs required for task 2 of this homework are included. After that, the user can find some commented examples of how to call each of the 3 templates with some restrictions on discovering rules. To try out some different rule restrictions on specific templates, user can uncomment the corresponding commands and modify the arguments.
